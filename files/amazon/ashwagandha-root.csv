ashwagandha-root,2022-08-15,I’ve tried ginkgo biloba before without any results. The lions mane formula with ginkgo is amazing.

ashwagandha-root,2022-08-12,I wasn't sure if this was going to work but someone recommended it to me and I had to try it. By the time I took the first capsule I felt it calm my gut.

ashwagandha-root,2022-02-09,Our 12 year old Rhodesian Ridgeback has GOLPP. We started feeding him 1/2 pill with breakfast and are convince it has helped to not only slow the weakening of his nerves but to actually repair some nerve damage.

ashwagandha-root,2021-07-20,Started taking this 3 weeks ago.  I have tried alot of supplements and these are easy to swallow - the capsules aren't like a horse pill and there is no "bad taste".  My daughter wanted to try them with me but she doesn't like mushrooms.  Neither of could taste mushrooms nor did it have any "earthy" flavor that some people are concerned about.  I have a bit of anxiety and I was looking for something to give me more focus and stronger mental performance.  So far so good!,4,Impressed by it's claims,Kindle Customer,example@example.com,TRUE

ashwagandha-root,2021-06-16,Recently introduced to the benefits of Lion's Mane Mushroom for brain and nerve support.  Really appreciate that this product is Non-GMO and made with organic mushrooms.  It is a bonus that the supplements are also gluten and grain free.  What makes this a no-brainer (no pun intended) for me is that Gaia screens their products and using a unique code on your product allows the purchaser to review the results of testing for microbes heavy metals pesticides and more.  You can also view the manufacturing date so you know when your product was created and when it will expire.  Love that this company shares this important information!  Earns my trust!,5,Excited about the difference this supplement can make,HK1,example@example.com,TRUE
ashwagandha-root,2021-10-17,I cannot say how much of a change I’ve seen with this product. I feel like a younger sharper version of myself. I also don’t have to take my ADHD medicine (Adderall) as much. It’s a gentle effect but it is very clear and real. My spouse has noticed how much more “with it” I’ve been. I’ve been taking this for three months and I plan to take it forever. Thank you Gaia!,5,Fantastic Results for Adult with ADHD and Memory Decline,Jessica Shane,example@example.com,TRUE

ashwagandha-root,2021-06-10,This is an easy to take odorless supplement. I have been taking the product for 2 weeks and don’t notice a big difference in mental clarity however I know with supplements you sometimes need to take over an extended period to notice a difference.

ashwagandha-root,2022-08-05,I had been wanting to get on Lion’s mane for awhile but kept forgetting/putting it off. (If you know you know how it is with ADHD). I struggle to remember to take things daily sometimes especially multiple times a day but because these capsules are concentrated and only require 1 a day I think that could really help folks with ADHD/people with memory problems. I have been having eye twitching on my left eye socket  for a few months now off and on. I have also been having twitching under my left eye on my cheek. I had gone to acupuncture and that didn’t do much. This can happen to me if I don’t sleep too well but obviously it hasn’t gotten much better and it feels like a very specific part of my body and face. I take vyvanse a few times a week and notice that when it wears off I get muscle twitches. (my eye was still twitching even on my days off from vyvanse). I have been on these capsules for a week and all of it is gone! I had suspected it was dopamine related because I know that dopamine receptors and lack there of can effect this kind of stuff. I’m just shocked it went away so quickly. I recommending this product to all of my friends with ADHD and those who are medicated. I plan on continuing to take it to see if it helps with brain fog memory focus and other ADHD symptoms but so far so good. Only took a few days to notice my first big difference. Truly amazing. Easy to swallow and doesn’t taste bad.,5,Noticeable effects in a week,Sam,example@example.com,TRUE

ashwagandha-root,2022-04-24,It blocks dht. As a woman long story short it lowers estrogen too. So many symptoms of low estrogen.

ashwagandha-root,2021-12-13,I've tried many many different lion's mane extracts and whole mushroom supplements over the years. THIS is the one. For me a noticeable neurologic effect within minutes of taking it with my morning coffee. Feels as if I'm giving my brain EXACTLY what it needs to thrive and perform at its best. It costs more than the competition because it's a noticeably higher quality product in my experience. I find Gaia's ashwagandha to also be of excellent quality compared to others I've tried. I would encourage anyone who takes lion's mane to compare this product to whatever it is they are currently taking.,5,My Personal Gold Standard for Lion's Mane Supplements,Brett,example@example.com,TRUE
ashwagandha-root,2022-05-30,These have worked for me.  They take the edge off that foggy head feeling and I can be sharper with my work/ on point.  I tried other popular brands and I picked this one because it does not make me jittery and feels like it holds steady throughout the day versus just right when you take it.  I take one in the AM and one in mid-afternoon.,5,Takes the fogginess away,Silver ZZ,example@example.com,TRUE
