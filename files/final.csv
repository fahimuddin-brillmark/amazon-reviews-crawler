ashwagandha-root,2022-08-12,I wasn't sure if this was going to work but someone recommended it to me and I had to try it. By the time I took the first capsule I felt it calm my gut. This might also lessen diarrhea because somehow when I take it I don't get diarrhea the next morning. Don't know if that's coincidence or not.Aside from that this improves my thinking and has all natural ingredients. Just the mushroom and vegan capsule.,4,Healthy herbal supplement that might work for gut disorders too,Amazon Customer,example@example.com,TRUE

ashwagandha-root,2022-02-09,Our 12 year old Rhodesian Ridgeback has GOLPP. We started feeding him 1/2 pill with breakfast and are convince it has helped to not only slow the weakening of his nerves but to actually repair some nerve damage. His rear legs are gaining some strength back and he is not chocking as much as he used to.

ashwagandha-root,2021-07-20,Started taking this 3 weeks ago.  I have tried alot of supplements and these are easy to swallow - the capsules aren't like a horse pill and there is no "bad taste".  My daughter wanted to try them with me but she doesn't like mushrooms.  Neither of could taste mushrooms nor did it have any "earthy" flavor that some people are concerned about.  I have a bit of anxiety and I was looking for something to give me more focus and stronger mental performance.  So far so good!,4,Impressed by it's claims,Kindle Customer,example@example.com,TRUE

ashwagandha-root,2021-06-16,Recently introduced to the benefits of Lion's Mane Mushroom for brain and nerve support.  Really appreciate that this product is Non-GMO and made with organic mushrooms.  It is a bonus that the supplements are also gluten and grain free.  What makes this a no-brainer (no pun intended) for me is that Gaia screens their products and using a unique code on your product allows the purchaser to review the results of testing for microbes heavy metals pesticides and more.  You can also view the manufacturing date so you know when your product was created and when it will expire.  Love that this company shares this important information!

ashwagandha-root,2021-06-17,I have been in search for some "brain food" and this has definitely helped me with clarity of my mind definitely feel more clear or alert in the head.

Love the entire line of GAIA,5,Actually noticed a difference with this product. GREATEFUL.,Lynda Vander Weit,example@example.com,TRUE
ashwagandha-root,2021-06-10,This is an easy to take odorless supplement. I have been taking the product for 2 weeks and don’t notice a big difference in mental clarity however I know with supplements you sometimes need to take over an extended period to notice a difference. I have noticed that I feel bloated over the last couple of weeks. Don’t want to assign blame to mushroom supplement but want to leave that here in case others notice as well.,3,Would like to notice more of a difference,C. Segress,example@example.com,TRUE

ashwagandha-root,2022-08-05,I had been wanting to get on Lion’s mane for awhile but kept forgetting/putting it off. (If you know you know how it is with ADHD). I struggle to remember to take things daily sometimes especially multiple times a day but because these capsules are concentrated and only require 1 a day I think that could really help folks with ADHD/people with memory problems. I have been having eye twitching on my left eye socket  for a few months now off and on. I have also been having twitching under my left eye on my cheek. I had gone to acupuncture and that didn’t do much. This can happen to me if I don’t sleep too well but obviously it hasn’t gotten much better and it feels like a very specific part of my body and face. I take vyvanse a few times a week and notice that when it wears off I get muscle twitches. (my eye was still twitching even on my days off from vyvanse). I have been on these capsules for a week and all of it is gone! I had suspected it was dopamine related because I know that dopamine receptors and lack there of can effect this kind of stuff. I’m just shocked it went away so quickly. I recommending this product to all of my friends with ADHD and those who are medicated. I plan on continuing to take it to see if it helps with brain fog memory focus and other ADHD symptoms but so far so good. Only took a few days to notice my first big difference. Truly amazing. Easy to swallow and doesn’t taste bad.,5,Noticeable effects in a week,Sam,example@example.com,TRUE
ashwagandha-root,2022-04-24,It blocks dht. As a woman long story short it lowers estrogen too. So many symptoms of low estrogen. I stopped taking it and took other things to raise it back up and I’m ok now. Still have bald spots but it’s growing back.,1,Hair fell out in patches and clumps,Hamid Qazi,example@example.com,TRUE
ashwagandha-root,2021-06-03,I’ve been taking these a week so far and they are great so far. Easy to swallow and no weird aftertaste. I’ve noticed a difference in my memory and focus so I’m going to make them part of my normal supplement routine.,5,Great supplement,nicole,example@example.com,TRUE

ashwagandha-root,2021-12-13,I've tried many many different lion's mane extracts and whole mushroom supplements over the years. THIS is the one. For me a noticeable neurologic effect within minutes of taking it with my morning coffee. Feels as if I'm giving my brain EXACTLY what it needs to thrive and perform at its best. It costs more than the competition because it's a noticeably higher quality product in my experience. I find Gaia's ashwagandha to also be of excellent quality compared to others I've tried. I would encourage anyone who takes lion's mane to compare this product to whatever it is they are currently taking.,5,My Personal Gold Standard for Lion's Mane Supplements,Brett,example@example.com,TRUE
ashwagandha-root,2022-05-30,These have worked for me.  They take the edge off that foggy head feeling and I can be sharper with my work/ on point.  I tried other popular brands and I picked this one because it does not make me jittery and feels like it holds steady throughout the day versus just right when you take it.  I take one in the AM and one in mid-afternoon.,5,Takes the fogginess away,Silver ZZ,example@example.com,TRUE
oil-of-oregano,2021-06-17,As a happily married woman I must say it’s quite amusing to men that we girls are always getting urinary tract infections (UTI) or at least have a much higher chance of getting it. Well one day my husband came down with it. He finally understands now how we girls feel! And not to be cliché-ish he refused to go to the doctor in the same way how he refused to read the manual to our new washing machine and dryer. Uhh! How do we girls ever put up with men and their machismo. He was experiencing pain in the bladder buttock the two bottom cheeks and his back. These were clear symptoms of UTI and it’s very dangerous. Going to the doctor was not an option for him so I had no choice but to consult the internet for advice and that eventually lead me to Amazon. As a precaution this is not medical advice so please consult your doctor if you or a love one has UTI. To make a long story short we researched and ordered a bunch of herbal pills that he used religiously over a period of 7 to 8 months. For added benefit we asked the real Man (no pun intended) upstairs for help. Herbal pills supplemented with a generous dose of daily prayer to Jesus. Slowly but surely he healed and was cured. Now he has no pain and infection down there and he can confidently hang out with his male friends and boast with great vanity about his masculinity once again “free at last free at last free at last!” Fighting UTI isn’t fun but if herbal medicine is strong enough for a man then it’s good enough for a woman. Here is a list of items for your perusal and research; most of which was bought here on Amazon.• Turmeric Curcumin - 2250mg/d - Veggie Caps - 95% Curcuminoids with Black Pepper Extract (Bioperine) - 750mg Capsules - 100% Organic - Most Powerful Turmeric Supplement with Triphala (180 Count).• Gaia Herbs Oil of Oregano Vegan Liquid Capsules 120 Count - Immune and Intestinal Support for Healthy Digestive Flora.• Ginger Capsules - 90 Kosher Vegan Caps with 1000mg Organic Ginger Root.• Nutricost Goldenseal Root 600mg 120 Capsules - Non-GMO Gluten Free Vegetarian Capsules.• Oregon's Wild Harvest Certified Organic Garlic Capsules Non-GMO 1575 MGS 90 Ct.• AZO Cranberry Urinary Tract Health Dietary Supplement 1 Serving = 1 Glass of Cranberry Juice Sugar Free 100 Count.• D-Mannose 1300 mg with Cranberry Extract Fast-Acting Flush Impurities Natural Urinary Tract Health- 100 Veggie Capsules.• Costco Kirkland Vitamin C tablets 1000mg.• Costco Kirkland Wildflower Honey.• Copious amounts of daily prayer to The Man upstairs.,5,Strong Enough for a Man but Made for a Woman,Cup a Noodles,example@example.com,TRUE
oil-of-oregano,2022-06-06,helped with herpes very well,5,excellent,Kimberlynn Myers,example@example.com,TRUE
oil-of-oregano,2019-05-26,I've had a bug for almost a week consisting of a very aggressive tickle/scratchy throat causing me to cough so much my ribs are sore. I've been drinking a mixture of honey lemon and Bragg Organic Apple Cider Venegar which has soothed the symptoms for the longest intervals. HEB Honey cough drops do well on the road but only for as long as they last in your mouth. This morning in church the scratchy throat was so persistent that I had to line up about 6 cough drops on my leg for easy access while listening to the sermon. The scratchy throat symptom has been very annoying making it even difficult to talk. I was getting concerned that maybe it's time for a doctor visit next week. It seemed to be getting very serious. I had looked online for any natural forms of antibiotics (non-prescription) that might work and customer reviews raved about this Oil of Oregano. So I ordered it from Amazon and it arrived today. I took one after lunch expecting it to take several days before I would notice any possible relief......WITHIN ONE HOUR - I repeat - WITHIN ONE HOUR - for the first time in 4 days my scratchy throat was GONE!!!!!!! I'm in shock folks! I still cough a little bit but not from the scratchy throat sensation. I have a little bug of some kind that feels like a mild cold. But the scratchy throat aspect of my condition is GONE!!!!! This Oil of Oregano is supposed to help your body's natural resistance to crud and it sure worked in a hurry for me! I know this is just after a few hours and symptoms could return. Whatever happens I'll post a follow-up and let you know. As of now I've never in my life seen any supplement get such amazing results! My capsules look like they may have dried up a bit (like another reviewer mentioned) but it apparently still works its magic!,5,AFTER ONE CAPSULE - AMAZING RESULTS!!!!!!,Rick Moore,example@example.com,TRUE
oil-of-oregano,2022-02-19,I pop 2-3 if these per day and squeeze it under my 8yr olds tongue. (old school way) so of course oil of oregano is a harsh tasting substance as a liquid. For me I take them the reg way. No flavor no issue swallowing them. This has been plenty helpful doing the pandemic. No colds no mucus issues.,5,Product that works,Saadiqah Warren,example@example.com,TRUE
oil-of-oregano,2020-11-26,For years I’ve been getting severe sinus and respiratory illnesses every fall that lasted almost into summer even had pneumonia twice. I’m otherwise healthy but felt like I was sick half a year almost. I was prescribed several different antibiotics steroids nebulizers etc. I tried several natural remedies as well but nothing seemed to help until I found oregano oil. While it didn’t completely take away my illness when it was at its worst I could tell it helped. I took it 3 times/day until my health improved then once per day for awhile. I stopped taking it for awhile but as soon as I feel congested or start getting a sore throat I’ll start taking this and it’s gone the next day. I also add olive leaf extract sometimes and take elderberry zinc and vitamin c and d almost daily (I was taking those in the past and still got sick). This fall and winter I’ve been the healthiest I can remember in a long time. I work in the OR so I’m around patients and other people constantly. Even though we wear masks all the time some of my coworkers have gotten Covid. Not sure if it’s just luck or the addition of this product that has kept me healthy. I’ll keep this in my medicine cabinet from now on.,5,Great immunity booster,Momma shops a lot,example@example.com,TRUE
oil-of-oregano,2021-04-23,Ok so I’m not sure where to begin but I have been struggling with Candida overgrowth (yeast) throughout my body for months after antibiotic use last summer. Probiotics have helped a ton and so did the Candida diet. I still had symptoms popping up from time to time including chills yeast infections headaches severe fatigue UTIs you name it. I reread my medical medium books and I decided to do his Anti-Bug cleanse and incorporate lemon balm and celery juice daily which yes seemed to help a lot but my girlie issues persisted. I purchased this product in the middle of a bad flare up. After the first pill I felt a bit dizzy but I took another one that night because I am very aware of die off symptoms. By the next morning though I had felt a huge shift in my health and energy levels. I am continuing taking these twice a day and I can feel improvement each time. I will update this review once I have completed my two week cycle but the way it’s looking right now this is the Holy Grail for Candida/yeast infections!,5,Curing Chronic Candida/Yeast,AuntieCoco,example@example.com,TRUE
oil-of-oregano,2020-11-14,I have thyroid disease. One day I woke up super bloated. Nothing helped. Doctors couldn't figure it out after lots of tests. So I put the pieces together along with extensive research and pretty sure I got SIBO. Since Covid is going on I don't wanna risk visiting any doctors offices right now to deal with this. I read Oil of Oregano can help. So I changed my probiotic to Saccharomyces boulardii and started taking that with this Oil of Oregano. I also did a low fodmap diet as best as I could. When I took this Oil of Oregano I didn't need my allergy medicine which was a nice benefit. I stopped taking it after 4 weeks because it's not good to take it long-term daily. It made SIBO bearable and allowed me to eat a little. It's not a cure for SIBO as SIBO is hard to get rid of but it helped me at least for a month. Good stuff. If you have SIBO there are other things needed but I also recommend a digestive enzyme going gluten free and stay away from sugar carbs and histamine foods.,5,Help with SIBO,Customer,example@example.com,TRUE
oil-of-oregano,2020-08-12,I took this for years of mold exposure and my doctors being chuckle heads dealing with it. My hair fell out in clumps a persistent 3 years long cough  stomach/ bowel distress. Eventually I had to stop working full time. Once my water tested positive for light traces of mold  I took this.Cons: I only lasted 4 days before my BPM dropped to 48 and it triggered headaches and heart palpitations from low heart rate. I've read it can lower absorption of iron zinc and something else. So if you're on the line like me taking it as directed could be too much.Pros: within the first day so much was coming out of my body. It was gross but necessary. Sweat mucus  toilet strips. I coughed out so much. I am breathing so much better now. I don't need my inhaler through the day like before. My sinuses are less stuffed.My concern is how powerful it is. Listen to your body and give your body a break if needed. The bottle instructs 2 pills a day 2-4 weeks... I could barely go 4 days one pill.,4,POWERFUL be CAREFUL,Christina Hill,example@example.com,TRUE

oil-of-oregano,2019-05-31,This stuff has kept me out of the hospital time and time again. I use it for anything problem that needs an antibiotic. This is natural and helps with king problems. I am pretty sure I had pneumonia twice and I just kept taking this along with black seed oil. The next day I was 50% better. I was so scared. I could hear the fluid gurgling when I was breathed and my breaths sounded like a truck. Towards the end of the night (of the next day) I was perfectly fine. I couldn't believe it. I had my stuff packed to go to the hospital and everything. I took a chance that many wouldn't understand but I trust my instincts.Don't take it for more than a month at a time and DO NOT EAT WITH FOOD!!!!!!!!!!!! I can't stress that enough! I made that mistake once and I will never forget it. If you want to know how to take it. Take it every 12 hours in between meals which means if you want to eat... Take it on an empty stomach and then wait an hour to eat. If you've already eaten... wait 2 hours to take it. This stuff is amazing to me. It helped clear up the fluid in my ear and irritation from my contact lenses as well. I love the Gaia brand!,5,Natural Antibiotic,Packie Tills,example@example.com,TRUE
oil-of-oregano,2021-07-03,Easy to swallow however I have in the past made my own capsules with a bottle of oregano oil and empty gel capsules and have not had any of the oregano flavor that way. These I have to try to keep from touching my tongue when I take them because the flavor does come through the capsule a bit. Effective but you ultimately have to decide if you’re willing to deal with a moment of unpleasant flavor.,4,Effective but slightly unpleasant,Sarah R.,example@example.com,TRUE
oil-of-oregano,2022-02-26,I have been taking this product for years and I highly recommend it!,5,FANTASTIC PRODUCT,parent and teacher,example@example.com,TRUE
oil-of-oregano,2021-02-23,This stuff is good to take if you feel like you’re fighting something off especially right away when you feel that. I take it with vitamin C airborne zinc and a couple other oral supplements. I also recommend taking raw garlic in the morning if you feel like you’re coming down with something. Best on a empty stomach. The best way to do it is to crush the garlic with something flat and let it sit there for five minutes before you take it. I mash it till it’s almost a paste (I use the back of a wooden spatula) put it on a spoon and swallow it with water right away so I don’t taste it too much. When you smash it and let it sit it releases all the good chemicals that are antibacterial and antiviral.,5,Good Stuff,Happycat,example@example.com,TRUE
oil-of-oregano,2022-02-09,This particular brand is high quality. I also use the cranberry. Worth the money and easy to swallow.,5,Immune suport,Likes a great deal...,example@example.com,TRUE
oil-of-oregano,2019-09-16,I use this product when I start feeling sick. I can't believe how well it works! I used to take a lot of them multiple times a day when I started feeling sick however I have since learned that they can still kill off your gut bacteria if you overdo it. So now I follow the instructions. Sometimes I can still tell that I'm sick (I may be a little extra tired slight scratchy throat slight stuffy nose) but the symptoms are so minimal they do not affect my everyday life. Some days I have no symptoms at all! This is a lifesaver for me because usually my colds really knock me out and I get sick for at least 2 weeks. With this product I may be sick for a week but like I said I will barely even notice. I'm not a doctor so I can't say to take or not take the dose that I do but I definitely would recommend giving it a go! I also really trust this brand and have tried a few of their products and have been satisfied.,5,Amazing for colds,KB,example@example.com,TRUE
oil-of-oregano,2019-07-28,Read a lot that people are starting to use Oregano oil instead of antibiotics.  Heard it's good to use for a handful of ailments and is a great preventive remedy.  Got some because of my hubby's allergies.  He can't take regular allergy medications because they dry him out so badly he gets bloody noses.  He wakes up every morning choking/puking from the phlegm running down the back of his throat.  Since he started taking this it has decreased about 90%.  There is still some and he has bad mornings sometimes.  But compared to not taking them it's wonderful.  Neither of us is sick frequently to speak to it taking care of illnesses.  We have now gone through 2 bottles and will continue with this product.  It seems effective.  When I put the capsule on my tongue I can taste the oregano after a few seconds.  It smells like the real deal too.  I recommend everyone keep some in your cabinet for those times when you aren't quite right and can feel something coming on.,5,Natural antibiotic,Karen Vint,example@example.com,TRUE
oil-of-oregano,2021-03-28,All I have to say is that I had a sore throat that started Tues evening. I don't know if I was getting the flu or COVID but I had a little left of my oil of oregano in liquid form so I took it.  The next morning I had a flaming headache to the point my eyes we're hurting.  Now I know a few people that had COVID said their eyes hurt.  I took 2 of these and I made a hot tea concoction with a frozen ginger cube honey and a sea moss gel cube. I drank it 3 times that Wed.  By 7pm my illnesses ceased!!! Y'all better get these pills they are the truth! I take them daily now!,5,COVID/FLU KILLER,E Harp,example@example.com,TRUE

oil-of-oregano,2018-09-22,I love... LOVE.. this oil! Most likely the most versitile oil you can get! With all the beautiful benefits of oregano I can't see ANYONE without it Do your research...! Anti-viral anti -bacterial anti-fungal anti-oxidant anti-inflammatory anti-parasitic & anti-microbial. You can even clean with it WOW!! (There are times Amazon puts Gaia brand on sale! A real bargin!!!)  It's a natural alternative to prescription antibiotics. Clip off the end of capsule squeeze out the oil in a little shallow cup add a tablespoon or two of a carrier oil (olive oil coconut oil  grape seed oil etc) mix and apply to burns cuts infected areas... etc and Gaia makes a very good capsule! Have a toe fungus a cough you can't shake this will be your go- to! I even use it diluted on my fur baby when he has a hot spot! My life line to health! Quick delivery packaged very good! 😊,5,Can be used topically diffused or taken internally,Greenhatgal54,example@example.com,TRUE
oil-of-oregano,2022-01-07,I bought the one with 120 capsules. It felt lighter than usual so I decided to count them. Three times. There were 119 and the caps are noticeably underfilled.

oil-of-oregano,2016-04-13,I've been using Gaia's Oil of Oregano for the last 6 years. I recommend it to all my family and friends. I find that the Gaia brand is the strong potency compared to other brands I tried in the past (trying to save money). I used to buy it at Whole Foods whenever it went on sale but now that I've found it on Amazon I just get it here. It's the cost of Whole Food's sale price.I always get the largest size and it lasts me for a good 3 to 4 months. I share them with my brother. It has really helped with my immune system. I rarely ever get sick and if I do it doesn't last long because I take these. I believe it's the best remedy when I'm sick. In the beginning when I first started taking these it used to make me burp a lot and tasted like pizza. Haha! I'm all about natural remedies. I recommend this over any over-the-counter drugs that have thousands of chemicals that most people don't know what they are let alone pronounce.I'm always highly recommending Gaia's Oil of Oregano (and their other products) to everyone that I feel that I should apply to work for them or at least be a brand ambassador. Haha! I LOVE GAIA!,5,I recommend it to all my family and friends,Lynda Bui,example@example.com,TRUE

oil-of-oregano,2020-09-26,I started taking this for sinus issues and it is absolutely amazing. It was recommended to me from a family member and I wouldn’t believe it if it didn’t do and help me so much! It really seems to keep me healthy clear of any allergy or sinus issues and also give a little burst of energy. You definitely need to drink a full glass of water with it and make sure you’re hydrated as it does seem like it can dehydrate you if you don’t drink enough water. You may have a slight oregano taste as well after taking the pill but it does go away eventually. Highly recommend.,5,HIGHLY RECOMMEND,Sherrie Bentley,example@example.com,TRUE
oil-of-oregano,2017-09-17,My family has used this product as needed for years and once my daughter goes back to school and flu season approaches I leave it on the counter as a reminder to use it regularly. I have noticed their are oregano products out now with very high % of the key ingredient in oil of oregano but I love that Gaia has its own farm that they can monitor the production of their supplements constantly that these are liquid gel caps because oregano is hard to take otherwise and I believe that there is a benefit to taking a holistic plant supplement that includes a wider range of what is in the plant knowing that there could be a synergistic effect and components of the plant that have beneficial properties but have yet to be researched through standard medical channels. Gaia is a brand that can be trusted and you actually know where the supplements are from. They also create jobs here in the US and it's nice to support that too. I love Gaia oil of oregano and along with the olive leaf extract you can trust that your body is being taken care of...... Love!,5,Gaia is great and so is this product!,Isabelsb,example@example.com,TRUE
oil-of-oregano,2019-03-19,I'm not holistic am not organic I am human and suffer from inflamed intestines and was diagnosed with  chronic bowl obstruction as a result of a accident. With that I'm confident this stuff resolved whatever issues I was having with my guts though some additional dietary restrictions were required. Oil of Oregano in addition to gold milk a drink I make with any non-dairy substitute (I prefer macadamia nut milk) turmeric pepper and cinnamon. It helps with bloating and what comes after the bloating..... I would recommend this to anyone with gut issues ask your doctor first to make sure this is not in conflict with other meds you may be taking. I'm grateful to have found something that actually worked for me.P.S. If you are living with gut issues I feel your pain most days suck figuring out what to eat or not eat sucks but once you find a solution it can be life changing so do not lose hope!,5,THIS STUFF WORKS,THE ENGINEER,example@example.com,TRUE

oil-of-oregano,2017-08-06,I have tried different brands and different forms of oregano. Gaia Hebs Oil of Oregano capsules (this product you are looking at) I would not say it is a bad product but way overrated. First off in my researching oregano oil I have found that you want a high percentage of Carvacrol. If "Nature's Way" brand of oregano oil has 50 mg of oregano oil which states that is has 75-85% Carvacrol. Yes they tell you right on the front label 75-85% and that is excellent.Gaia says 32 mg of oregano and that is IMO not good or for a better term okay. Not to mention that it is ecologically harvested (going to research what the heck that means now) with a statement (this is what it means to me "this may not be entirely true"). The only reason I bought this brand is because of my stupid research of finding "the best Oregano oil". This brand was higher rating than Natures Way on two websites.I will go back to Nature's Way brand. Especially after what I seen on Frontline (PBS) last night. Long story short "herbal supplements are not regulated. Some supplements do not have any of the herb vitamins or they have bad chemicals in them or way too much. The (PBS) episode of Frontline was first aired 1/19/2016 season 34 episode 9. I wish I would have seen it back then.I want honest answers to questions. Honesty will get my business. I want honest reviews. WHERE IS THE HONESTY!!!?Update: Who is responsible? I just noticed that on this product that the 60 count according to the picture has more oregano ( 64mg ).I purchased the 120 count thinking I was getting a better deal (more bang for my buck). So misleading. Gaia how do you keep your customers?,3,Answer the simple question "How much?,Jeff,example@example.com,TRUE
oil-of-oregano,2019-07-15,Was not that powerful to cure my tonsillitis. For 2 months I and my husband suffered from tonsillitis. Doctors at kaiser were reluctant to prescribe antibiotics. So we tried out this oil. Somewhat it reduced some symptoms of cold but not tonsillitis. At least we had to take antibiotics erythromycin for 5 days and then only everything got cured. As per my experience I think oil of oregano is overly popularized. But yes when you it in am empty stomach it hurts the stomach. According to Ayurveda it says that oregano oil increases pitta or fire which is needed to burn up toxins etc. But if pitta is too much also it is not good. So I think there should be balance. Will I recommend? Not probably. I think cow urine tablets are far better than this.,4,Was not that powerful to cure my tonsillitis,Vi,example@example.com,TRUE

oil-of-oregano,2021-07-01,This stuff is fantastic.

oil-of-oregano,2016-06-22,I was told by my nurse practitioner that she suspected I have SIBO which is an overgrowth of small intestine bacteria. I did a bunch of reading and saw oil of oregano is a recommended remedy. I clearly had something nasty in my system because within the first week taking the caps I started experiencing Herheimer effects. For those stating severe side effects to oil of oregano.... it's worth reading about die off symptoms and the Herxheimer effect. You will be tempted to stop taking the caps but stick with it because that ended by the second week and I'm in week three of taking them. My stomach pain is gone as well as bloating. I also got a small bit of an itchy rash on my legs which is now gone. I will take the caps for 4 weeks as recommended on the bottle and then stop to let my body rest. I highly recommend this product and urge people to read about die off symptoms so they know to power through. It's more than worth it to kill off whatever nastiness is running through your body!,5,Amazing! Power through die off symptoms!,Amber S.,example@example.com,TRUE
oil-of-oregano,2019-09-18,My daughter suggested I take oregano oil when I complained of UTI symptoms including severe bladder spasms odorous urine backache and bloating.  She suggested 4 caps 3 times/day for a week.  Within 24 hours the spasms subsided about 80%.  Within 48 hours no more spasms at all.  I continued for the whole week and feel great!  Energy back.  No symptoms at all.  BTW...in the middle of the therapy I ran out so ordered more but went to Whole Foods and bought their brand to get by until the Gaia arrived.  In less than 12 hours the spasms returned - the Whole Foods brand wasn't nearly as effective.,5,Da Bomb for UTI,Debra Noe,example@example.com,TRUE
oil-of-oregano,2019-12-15,These have helped me build my immune system over time. I started taking them after experiencing terrible colds back to back.The capsules themselves look strange because you can see the liquid inside. However don’t be turned away be their appearance because they really work! I just recommend taking them with food and water and not doing any sort of exercise for a period after because you may experience some burping.I haven’t gotten sick since starting these and I feel healthier overall.

oil-of-oregano,2019-04-12,I’m absolutely in LOVE with oil of oregano! I had never tried it but always wanted to and I’m so glad I did. Whenever I’m starting to feel a cold coming on I take one pill a day (I don’t even need 2 as it suggests) and I’m pretty much cold-free. I have 3 kids and am also a massage therapist so I come into contact with a lot of people and I didn’t get sick at all this past winter because of these capsules! All I got was a little bit of the sniffles but not a full blown cold like I get every single winter. I swear by these!,5,Great for cold/flu season!,DJ,example@example.com,TRUE
oil-of-oregano,2018-11-26,My doc suggested I take this twice a day until our next visit which is in about 1 1/2 month to clear out some gut bacteria.  I take it during the week and give my body a moment over the weekend.  It makes me gassy.  On the other hand I do notice a difference in my stomach/bowl issues.  Over the weekend I drink lemon water to flush my liver out of any toxins and back on this for Mon - Fri.  It's working better for me that way.  Besides the gas...It's doing what its suppose to do and my hubby is noticing the difference.,4,A little Gassy!,Y. Medina,example@example.com,TRUE
oil-of-oregano,2017-04-18,Gaia oil of oregano pills don't cause me any stomach upset at all.  I started taking them about a week ago.  one capsule twice a day between meals.  on about day three I started to feel tired I guess because the yeast were dying off.  I was tired for 2-3 days and this morning I woke up early and energized.  I am also not craving sweets.  I also didn't even need my cup of tea to wake me up.  I took 2 sips and that's it.  this is a big change for me.  I will take these pills for another few weeks.  the bottle says to take no more than 2-4 weeks and then stop.  I am very satisfied and highly recommend these for people with yeast problems.,5,No stomach upset highly recommend these for people with yeast problems.,annabella,example@example.com,TRUE
oil-of-oregano,2015-01-09,If you suffer from IBS you may find help with this product. Every now and then my IBS will flare up. A friend who is very into natural remedies suggested taking it but make sure it's 100% Oil of Oregano (this one is). I was skeptical but it actually seems to improve my IBS flare ups when I take it for 2 weeks. It's like it resets my digestive system. I never take it longer than 2 weeks due to its natural mild antibiotic properties. (Please if you have an infection don't rely on this speak to your doctor)Do be aware when you take these capsules you will begin burping oregano when it breaks open in your stomach. Not the worst thing to be burping if you love oregano like I do. If you are not fond of oregano you've been warned!,4,IBS Sufferers!,K. Gabel,example@example.com,TRUE

oil-of-oregano,2017-03-27,This stuff is amazing! After doing some online research I thought it would be good to try when viruses start spreading around work. Literally everyone except me caught the last flu bug. Had read it would also be good for warts (in addition to several other things). So I put some on a piece of gauze for 2 days and the wart is completely gone. My friend was getting ready to go on a trip and still had a cold in spite of running out of her prescription.  I gave her some of my Oil of Oregano and when she flew out 2 days later she was symptom free. So she had me order her a bottle too.  I love finding natural products that save me from a doctors visit and this is it.,5,Better than prescription antibiotics,Whole Living,example@example.com,TRUE
oil-of-oregano,2018-10-29,I was worried that this product would be abrasive to my gut flora. Oregano products sometimes leave my gut flora obliterated too dramatically to where even a strong probiotic doesnt help. The Gaia Oregano capsules I take before eating and I never notice much if I forget to eat actually. I have Gastritis/SIBO and been curing it with these Hawaiin Spirulina/Heathers Tummy Savers/and a little Oregano. Works wonders everyone especially the first two supplements I mentioned Spirulina is a blue green algae that is a super hero in my book but its this Hawaiin 1000mg tablet I found that really does the trick. Still to help kill off the bacteria the oregano is moving the process along.,5,Helps with My Gastritis/SIBO and Gentle on the Stomach,brian,example@example.com,TRUE

Aside from its myriad of other benefits oil of oregano is a miracle hangover cure. Never again suffer from your bad choices with a bottle of oil of oregano at your side!Oil of oregano (if your constitution can handle it) is quite the panacea the only downside is if you are taking it for nausea or an upset stomach be careful to keep it down at all costs as oil of oregano coming back up is just awful.Happy oregano burps!,5,One of nature's great wonders.,WM,example@example.com,TRUE

I love the Gaia brand and the oregano capsules are simple to take--occasionally I will have an oregano burp but that is much better than having a full-blown respiratory infection.

oil-of-oregano,2019-05-26,I take oregano oil for Ulcerative Colitis and for me it's been close to a miracle cure. It's the only thing that allows me to eat solid foods without the horrible repercussions of bleeding and everything just running through me undigested.  Maybe that's TMI but thats how important oregano oil is to me.  I was getting oregano and thyme oil caps from a Canadian brand but their stock availability is very unpredictable.  I tried these as an alternative that would hopefully be available on a more consistent basis but I find that they are completely ineffective.  I was in 90% remission on the Canadian brand for months felt amazing finally getting some nutrients into my body. As soon as I switched to this brand within two weeks I had two epic flareups and felt like I was dying again.  I had to go back on the dreaded smoothies only diet.  I'm not sure what the difference is between the two brands maybe the batch I got was low in active compounds even though its supposedly standardized concenteations.

oil-of-oregano,2019-03-05,I'm not sure if something went wrong with this batch with the way it was stored by Amazon or what but this is not oil any longer.  I took one of these capsules per the instructions on the bottle between meals.  By the next day I had abdominal cramping from the moment I woke up until the moment I went to sleep.  It felt like someone was constantly pulling on my intestines.  I've had herxheimer effect before and trust me this wasn't it.  I then did some investigating by cutting open the capsules.  I thought they were black because of something in the capsule coating but actually it was the contents that were black and incredibly viscous/sticky.  Not oil-like at all.  In the third picture I attached to this review I added a few drops of another oil of oregano I have on hand.  It is a light golden color (yes it is a bit diluted with olive oil but still...it's nothing even close to black).  I normally am a fan of Gaia herbs and their policies/practices but something went very wrong here.  Oil of oregano can be a potent tincture and dangerous if not used appropriately.

oil-of-oregano,2015-12-24,What can I say? I feel sick when I take it for the first couple hours but then stronger than ever afterwards. Making sure to drink lots of water helps dismiss the nausea big time!I started taking this for a major candida overgrowth problem. My stools were full of candida and I felt tired and a bit weak. I was worried and so started on this along with a couple other supplements. The first night I took it (last Saturday) it seemed to all go to boosting my immune system beyond what I could have imagined. The scratchy throat I had and weaknesses from cold weather disappeared and I proceeded to stay up till 3am that night at a party with NO immune repercussions which amazed me.The next day the nausea started. The good news was that the candida immediately decreased in my stools to the point I could barely see it and once the slight upset stomach subsided I felt more clear and strong in my body than before starting the supplement. By the third day the nausea lessened drinking lots of water and fourth day it was barely noticeable. I took a day off then and that brings us to today when I took it again and had to lay down for a while this morning from the semi sick feeling the oil gives. They say this is the candida die off symptoms. As long as I eat 30 min after taking it and drink tons of water that seems to help. I'm sticking with this for a little while since I'm not working this week and can deal with a little nausea to make my body stronger,4,Taking for Candida.

oil-of-oregano,2015-04-01,My wife was prescribed four different antibiotics over a four month period for chronic swollen glands and low grade fever. Her blood tests showed a "Nonspecific Infection." She felt lethargic spacey and some days she couldn't even get out of bed. When told to try yet another antibiotic she went instead to a local reputable health food store. An older European woman sold my wife Gaia Oil of Oregano and told her to take "4 capsules 4 times a day" until better continuing that dose for four days after she was better then reduce it to "3 capsules 3 times a day" for four days "2 capsules twice a day" for four days then "2 capsules once a day" for lifetime maintenance increasing the dose again at the first sign of any kind of infection sinus allergy or indigestion. After two days my wife was 100% better. By day three all symptoms were gone and have not returned. After 2 months of superior health she still takes 2 capsules twice a day but will soon taper to 2 once a day. She has more energy and her mood is lighter and brighter than it has ever been. One month ago I started taking 2 capsules once a day for chronic digestive problems. They have disappeared. This product has been a miracle for us.,5,Really Worked!,Rudy G,example@example.com,TRUE

oil-of-oregano,2019-03-17,I would NEVER suggest this product to anyone!!  I came down with a cold recently and loaded up on my typical vitamins which I’ve taken time and time again.  The only new one that I decided to give a try because of all the wonderful things I’ve heard about it was Oil of Oregano by Gaia!  Never again.  I had the most severe pain in my upper intestine for about 8 hours and I’ve finally just thrown up and smelled a horrid smell of oregano.  This pain was so severe that I was begging my finance to take me to the ER.  He’s been by my side all day trying to find out a way to avoid going to the ER and accruing medical expenses.  After suffering for 8 hours straight I’ve finally gotten a bit of relief by making myself throw up.  It seemed to be severe acid reflex.  Now I’m finding out a lot of people have had this side effect occur from oil of oregano even some permanent side effects.
